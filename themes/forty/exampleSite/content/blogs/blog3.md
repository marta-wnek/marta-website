I am a person of many interests and I believe that nothing exists in isolation. As such, in order to become an expert in a given area, it is essential to have an understanding of the overlapping disciplines, ie. fields which have an impact on your area of expertise. 

This idea is reflected in my career choices: I strive to make a difference in the business world, while still bringing to the table tangible skills.

As a Strategy Consultant I strive to provide top-quality advice on the strategy and operations of the company, which aligns with company's vision. Therefore, a strong and diverse business acumen is key. Simultaneously, with technology revolutionising more and more aspects of the business, incl. analysing the historic performance, monitoring the daily operations as well as modelling financial forecasts, I appreciate the importance of the indepth data analytics skills.

I have an interest in financial, legal and behavioural aspects, and I appreciate that knowledge and experience in all these is key to handle the complexity of running a business. Nonetheless, to be an efficient consultant I also need to be acquainted with methods to devise a successful marketing strategy, which simultaneously is cost-efficient, compliant with the latest regulations, effective in the current geopolitical landscape and driven by firmâ€™s underpinning strategy and spirit.
