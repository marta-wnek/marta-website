# Climate change and temperature anomalies

If we wanted to study climate change, we can find data on the *Combined
Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies* in the
Northern Hemisphere at [NASA's Goddard Institute for Space
Studies](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp). The [tabular data of
temperature anomalies can be found
here](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v4/NH.Ts+dSST.txt)

To define temperature anomalies I need to have a reference, or base, period which NASA clearly states that it is the period between
1951-1980.

I ran the code below to load the file:

```{r weather_data, cache=TRUE}

weather <- 
  read_csv("https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v4/NH.Ts+dSST.csv", 
           skip = 1, 
           na = "***")

```



**NOTE:** When using this function, I added two options: `skip` and
`na`:

1.  ***The `skip=1`*** option is there as the real data table only starts in Row 2, so I need to skip one row.

2.  ***`na = "***"`*** option informs R how missing observations in the spreadsheet are coded. When looking at the spreadsheet, you can see that missing data is coded as "\*\*\*". It is good practice to specify this here, as otherwise some of the data is not recognized as numeric data.

3. Once the data is loaded, there is an ***object titled `weather`
in the `Environment` panel***. 



**Side note**: If you cannot see the panel (usually on the
top-right), go to `Tools` \> `Global Options` \> `Pane Layout` and tick the checkbox next to `Environment`. Click on the `weather` object, and the dataframe will pop up on a seperate tab. Inspect the dataframe.

For each month and year, the dataframe shows the deviation of
temperature from the normal (expected). Further, the dataframe is in wide format.





# Cleaning the data

First, I cleaned the data to leave only the relevant ones for the analysis:

- Selected the year and the twelve month variables from the `weather` dataset.

- Converted the dataframe from wide to 'long' format, and named the new dataframe as `tidyweather`, the variable containing the name of the month as `month`, and the temperature deviation values as `delta`.



```{r tidyweather}

# Create tidyweather data
tidyweather <- weather %>% 
  select(-c("J-D", "D-N", "DJF", "JJA", "MAM", "SON")) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = -Year, names_to = "month", values_to = "delta")
```


- Then, I inspected this dataframe to have three variables now, one each for:
    * year,
    * month, and
    * delta, or temperature deviation.
  





## Plotting Information

For the purpose of the analysis, I needed to plot the data using a time-series scatter plot, and add a trendline. 

*To do that, I first needed to create a new variable called `date` in order to ensure that the `delta` values are plot chronologically.*



**NOTE:**
> In the following chunk of code, I used the `eval=FALSE` argument, which does not run a chunk of code; 

> I did so that I can knit the document before tidying the data and creating a new dataframe`tidyweather`. 

> To actually run this code and knit this document, `eval=FALSE` must be deleted, **not just here but in all chunks were `eval=FALSE` appears.**



```{r scatter_plot}

# Set date format tidyweather data
tidyweather <- tidyweather %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), month, "1")),
         month = month(date, label=TRUE),
         year = year(date))

# Plot weather anomalies
ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Weather Anomalies"
  )

```



To verify if the effect of increasing temperature is more pronounced in some months, I used `facet_wrap()` to produce a separate scatter plot for each month, again with a smoothing line. 



```{r facet_wrap, echo=FALSE}

# Plot faceted weather anomalies
ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  facet_wrap(~ month) +
  labs (
    title = "Faceted Weather Anomalies"
  )

```



# Conclusion 1:
Based on the plots, it can be implied that the effect of increasing temperature is more pronounced in the winter months - starting from the end of fall until the start of spring. I can see this from the higher values within the winter months over the other months across time. **This reflects the effects of global warming/climate change throughout the last decade.**



**NOTE:**
- It is sometimes useful to group data into different time periods to study historical data. *For example, we often refer to decades such as 1970s, 1980s, 1990s etc. to refer to a period of time.* 
> Here, NASA calculates a temperature anomaly, as a difference from the base period of 1951-1980.



With the code below I: 
- Created a new data frame called `comparison` that groups data in five time periods: 1881-1920, 1921-1950, 1951-1980, 1981-2010 and 2011-present.
- Removed data before 1800 and before using `filter`. 
- Used the `mutate` function to create a new variable `interval` which contains information on which period each observation belongs to. 
- Assigned the different periods using `case_when()`.




```{r intervals}

# Assign periods
comparison <- tidyweather %>% 
  filter(Year>= 1881) %>%     #remove years prior to 1881
  #create new variable 'interval', and assign values based on criteria below:
  mutate(interval = case_when(
    Year %in% c(1881:1920) ~ "1881-1920",
    Year %in% c(1921:1950) ~ "1921-1950",
    Year %in% c(1951:1980) ~ "1951-1980",
    Year %in% c(1981:2010) ~ "1981-2010",
    TRUE ~ "2011-present"
  ))

```



Next:
- Inspected the `comparison` data frame by clicking on it in the
`Environment` pane.

- Now, that I have the `interval` variable, I could create a ***density plot*** *to study the distribution of monthly deviations* (`delta`), *grouped by the different time periods* we are interested in. 

- Set `fill` to `interval` to group and colour the data by different time periods.




```{r density_plot}

# Create density plot of monthly deviation based off each interval period
ggplot(comparison, aes(delta, fill = interval, alpha = 0.1)) +
  geom_density() +
  labs(title = "Denisty plots of monthly deviations", subtitle = "Separated by Intervals", x = "Delta", y = "Density") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 14, hjust = 0.5),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12, hjust = 0.5),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 10)
)

```





# Conclusion 2: {.underline}

From 1881 until 1980, I did not observe huge anomalies in terms of
temperature delta from the base period (1951-1980). However, this was not reflected past 1980; temperatures began rising more drastically from 1981-present. More strikingly, the average delta for the last period is around 0.5 higher than that of the previous period (1981-2010). *This hints at even higher average deviations in future that come faster unless a downward pressure is exerted on temperature increases through climate change measures.*

So far, I have been working with monthly anomalies. However, we might be interested in average annual anomalies. I did this by using:
- `group_by()` and `summarise()`, followed by
- a scatter plot to display the result.



```{r averaging}

# Create yearly averages
average_annual_anomaly <- comparison %>%
  group_by(Year) %>% 
  summarise(mean_delta_year = mean(delta))

# plot mean annual delta across years:
ggplot(average_annual_anomaly, aes(x = Year, y= mean_delta_year)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(colour = "red", method = "loess") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Yearly Weather Anomalies",
    y = "Mean annual delta"
  )
#Fit the best fit line, using LOESS method
#change theme to theme_bw() to have white background + black frame around plot

```




# Conclusion 3:{.underline}

Like what I was hinting at earlier, **the yearly anomalies over the past four decades (starting from 1980) have followed a relatively exponential upward trend**. During the 1980s, the average yearly delta was between 0 and 0.5 whereas this average has climbed past 1.5 in the most recent years. This increase of 1 degree overall has not been witnessed in the century prior to 1980, thus **emphasising the magnitude of the rapidly worsening global warming phenomenon.**





## Confidence Interval for `delta`

[NASA points out on their
website](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/world-of-change/decadaltemp.php)
that

> A one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast
> amount of heat to warm all the oceans, atmosphere, and land by that
> much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge
> the Earth into the Little Ice Age.



Here, I constructed a confidence interval for the average annual delta since 2011, both using a formula and using a bootstrap simulation with the `infer` package. 



**NOTE:**
**Recall that the dataframe `comparison` has already grouped temperature anomalies according to time intervals;** => we are only interested in what is happening between 2011-present.




```{r, calculate_CI_using_formula}

# Formula method of CI calculation
formula_ci <- comparison %>%
  filter(interval == "2011-present") %>%
  drop_na() %>% 
  summarise(mean_delta = mean(delta),
                     sd_delta = sd(delta),
                     count = n(),
                     t_critical = qt(0.975, count-1),
                     se_delta = sd_delta / sqrt(count),
                     margin_of_error = t_critical * se_delta,
                     delta_low  = mean_delta - margin_of_error,
                     delta_high  = mean_delta + margin_of_error
            )
# Print out formula_CI
formula_ci


library(infer)
# Bootstrap method of CI calculation using Infer package
infer_bootstrap_ci <- comparison %>%
  filter(interval == "2011-present") %>%
  specify(response = delta) %>%
  generate(reps = 1000,  type = "bootstrap") %>% 
  calculate(stat = "mean", na.rm = TRUE) %>% 
  get_confidence_interval(level = .95)
# Print out bootstrap CI using Infer package
infer_bootstrap_ci

```




# Conclusion 4:{.underline}

The results give an interesting insight into the sea and land
temperature differences during the 2011 - present time interval. The mean of the temperature delta is around 1.06 degrees. By means of a confidence interval calculation I can **state with 95% certainty that the mean temperature delta is between 1.02 and 1.11 degrees for this time period**. As there is no underlying distribution, I used the t-statistics and a degrees of freedom of n-1 to calculate the critical values required for a confidence interval calculation. 

I confirmed this estimate by using a bootstrapping method that manually created the confidence intervals and provided a lower bound of 1.02 degrees and a upper bound of 1.11 degrees.
