<div id="objectives" class="section level1">
<h1>Objectives:</h1>
<p>The purpose of this project is to:

<h1>Data:</h1>
<p>The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) has a a very interesting data set on the adoption of about 200 technologies in more than 150 countries since 1800. This is the<a href="https://www.nber.org/research/data/cross-country-historical-adoption-technology">Cross-country Historical Adoption of Technology (CHAT) dataset</a>.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong>
This is a very rich data set, not just for energy and CO2 data, but for many other technologies.</p>
<p>First, I:
- Produced a graph with the countries with the highest and lowest % contribution of renewables in energy production.
<em>This is made up of <code>elec_hydro</code>, <code>elec_solar</code>, <code>elec_wind</code>, and <code>elec_renew_other</code>.</em>
- Used the <em>patchwork</em> package to assemble the two charts next to each other:</p>
<p><img src="../../images/renewables.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong>
- Decided to filter on <code>year == 2019</code> only to replicate the graphs shown since the subtitle, in the plots above it says “2019 data”
- Needed to extract specific types of energy to create a ‘renewable energy’ column:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Create country&#39;s proportion of total energy production that stems from renewable sources
# We used 2019 data only (see NOTE above code chunk)

  select(-label) %&gt;%

  mutate(renewables_proportion = round((elec_hydro + elec_solar +
  elec_wind + elec_renew_other) / elecprod, 3) * 100) %&gt;% 
  #Create proportion variable.  
  #Take note that we round to 3 here to perfectly replicate the
  #graph shown above. 
  #Any other value will return a slightly different plot
  arrange(desc(renewables_proportion)) %&gt;% 
  ungroup() %&gt;%
  filter(renewables_proportion &gt; 0)

<h1>Conclusion:</h1>
<p>From observing the animation, two features are striking:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The first would be that we observe an <strong>inverse relationship between CO2 emissions and % renewables</strong>; that is, <em>when a larger proportion of a country’s energy production comes from renewable sources, the lower the CO2 emissions for that country and vice-versa</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is represented by the points that move along a north-west to south-east line in each of the income group plots. This can mostly be seen in all facets except “Low Income”; these countries had CO2 emissions that stayed pretty much constant no matter how their % renewables changed.</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The second pattern we notice is that for <strong>countries in the High Income</strong> group, there <strong>exist a few select countries in which % renewable energy production proportion remained relatively constant despite CO2 emissions fluctuating drastically</strong> (CO2 emissions changed perhaps due to compliance to climate change regulations); <strong>these are also the same countries with the highest CO2 emissions amongst all other countries</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Likewise, <em>many other countries changed the extent to which they relied on renewable energy in their energy output but had no change to CO2 emissions</em>; these were mainly countries with relatively lower CO2 emissions to begin with.
=&gt; This pattern implies that, <strong>for these countries, there exists almost no correlation between CO2 per cap and % renewables</strong> across time.</p>

<h1>Animation:</h1>
<p>I produced an animation to explore the relationship between
CO2 per capita emissions and the deployment of renewables:</p>
